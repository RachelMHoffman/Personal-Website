# Project Objective and Process Summary

This is a personally coded website I made in 2022 using Visual Studio Code. My goal was to create a simple one-page website about myself, not focusing on communicating any weighty or intensive content, but to demonstrate my HTML/CSS proficiency for prospective employers/recruiters and let this project serve as an opportunity to grow and solidify my web design/development skillset. I have created two versions ("Retro" first, and then "Modern") of a personal website with slight differences in HTML code and more significant differences in CSS code, to showcase more than one design example. Self-education websites such as W3Schools and Skillshare served as helpful guides throughout the experience in terms of researching to identify sources/causes of syntax errors, correcting syntax errors, and learning new syntax.

# Project Screenshots and Design Explanations

I searched for and abided by a color palette involing the themes of "Vintage", "Retro", "Rustic", or "Fall", to aid me in element color decision-making. I selected a professional Serif-style font to use for body text and a graceful Handwritten-style font to use for heading text. I implemented a welcome message and an About Me paragraph that I also use on my portfolio website and Linkedin profile.

I searched for and used license-free images of various office visuals to get across the type of work I want to do. I wanted the core body of my website to focus on my portfolio works, and so I established a table of cells with accompanying images and descriptions that link to my portfolio's different category pages.

To create visual interest, I implemented a hover effect on the three cells containing the links, in order to bring the cells' background color opacities up -- drawing the eye more towards the text within. The font also changes to a darker color on hover, to establish increased readability against a cell's darkened background color.

In my footer section, I offer the reader icon links for the different ways to contact me. Each icon has a hover effect implemented which brings the icons' color opacities up, to establish visual interest. The remainder of the footer contains a message that links back to this README document, and a statement of copyright.

# Terms of Use

As this code was written from scratch with no bootstrapped aspects, and was written for the purpose of delivering proof of concept to potential employers - I would appreciate this code not be copied and re-used, as it could give the idea to professionals visiting this project that this project is unoriginal and could suggest possible plagarism on my part. As for the assets not created by myself, I obviously don't discourage utilizing these; please see the Asset Credits section above for sourcing information.
