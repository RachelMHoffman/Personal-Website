# Project Objective

This is a personally coded website I made in 2022 using Visual Studio Code. My goal was to create a simple one-page website about myself, not focusing on communicating any weighty or intensive content, but to demonstrate my HTML/CSS proficiency for prospective employers/recruiters and let this project serve as an opportunity to grow and solidify my web design/development skillset. I have created two versions (retro and modern) of a personal website with slight differences in HTML code and more significant differences in CSS code, to showcase more than one design example.
