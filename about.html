  <p class="body-paragraph">Welcome! My name is Rachel and you've reached my portfolio of personal projects in the areas of UX/UI and Logo Design. 
    My first project here was the Hourglass website design prototype, the first version of which I started work on in December 2021. 
    Since then, this portfolio has served as a journey of self-teaching and diligent, gradually improved UI design, UX research, and logo design. 
    Adobe Creative Cloud applications XD and Illustrator, and the digital illustration app Procreate, are the primary design tools I used in building these projects.
    Maze is the user testing website I implemented to gather real user insights on the first versions of my UI projects, which helped guide me in creating my finalized versions.</p>
  <p class="body-paragraph">I am open to entry-level, remote design roles within teams interested in welcoming first-time designers. 
    In my spare time, I love working out, volunteering, traveling, video games, and watching movies and TV.</p>
